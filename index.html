								<h3>First durga puja together</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This was the day you were caught, that you were out for durga puja with a boy. Your mom got furious on you discovering this fact. You uninstalled all possible evidences from your phone out of fear. Huh.... but but but, luck was prevailing that day for us that your mom stopped shouting at you when she found out it was none other than Utsanjan, yours' beloved childhood classmate.</p>

								<h3>our most used couple picture</h3>
							</header>
							<p>These days were really so special. I was out for my certificate courses in Salt Lake City and used to come everyday infront of your PG until you got ready with your outfit and makeup. Then you came out with a handkerchief and a bottle of water. We went walking towards the CKCL Park where we sat down on a bench. There you wiped my sweaty face and kissed me. This picture was taken in that very place.</p>

								<h3>happy new year 2019</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This day was 1st January, 2019. My mother used to be strict on me those days. Still we decided to meet on that special day as we were both in our hometown, Haldia. We planned to meet in Hazramore. But unfortunately I could not find you there as you already left towards Durgachowk to buy your cosmetics. That did'nt demotivated me though. I went into the street near your home and waited there for you to return. There we met and clicked this selfie. I know we had short time to meet but those memorires can not be forgotten. Happy New Year my Love.</p>

This was the place where this picture was clicked.</p>
